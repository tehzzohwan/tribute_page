                    <legend><strong>In 1896</strong></legend>
                    <li> - Some years before Awolowo was born, his father became one of the first Ikenne natives to
                        convert to Christianity. Awolowo's paternal grandmother, Adefule Awolowo, whom Awolowo adored,
                        was a devout worshipper of the If√°. Adefule, Awolowo's grandmother, believed that Obafemi was a
                        reincarnation of her father (his great-grandfather). Awolowo's father's conversion to
                        Christianity often went at odds with his family's beliefs. He often challenged worshippers of
                        the god of smallpox, Obaluaye</li>

                        sawyer, and Mary Efunyela Awolowo. He had two sisters and one maternal half-sister. Awolowo's
                        father was born to a high chief and member of the Iwarefa, the leading faction of the
                        traditional Osugbo group that ruled Ikenne

                        various schools, including Baptist Boys' High School (BBHS), Abeokuta; and then became a teacher
                        in Abeokuta, after which he qualified as a shorthand typist. Subsequently, he served as a clerk
                        at the Wesley College Ibadan, as well as a correspondent for the Nigerian Times. It was after
                        this that he embarked on various business ventures to help raise funds to travel to the UK for
                        further studies

                    <li> - Awolowo founded the Nigerian Tribune, a private Nigerian newspaper, which he used to spread
                        nationalist consciousness among Nigerians

                    <legend><strong>From 1952 to 1959</strong></legend>
                    <li> - Awolowo was the first Leader of Government Business and Minister of Local Government and
                        Finance, and first Premier of the Western Region under Nigeria's parliamentary system
                    </li>

                <fieldset>

                    <legend><strong>1947</strong></legend>
                    <li> - Awolowo was Nigeria's foremost federalist. In his Path to Nigerian Freedom <br> - The first
                        Nigerian politician to have a systematic federalist manifesto
                    </li>

                <fieldset>
                    <legend><strong>1954</strong></legend>
                    <li> - He led demands for a federal constitution, which was introduced in the 1954 Lyttleton
                        Constitution, following primarily the model proposed by the Western Region delegation led by him
                    </li>
                    <hr>
                    <li>- As premier, he proved to be and was viewed as a man of vision and a dynamic administrator.
                        Awolowo was also the country's leading social democratic politician. He supported limited public
                        ownership and limited central planning in government. He believed that the state should channel
                        Nigeria's resources into education and state-led infrastructural development

                    <legend><strong>In 1959</strong></legend>
                    <li> - Controversially, and at considerable expense, he introduced free primary education for all
                        and free health care for children in the Western Region, established the first television
                        service in Africa, and the Oduduwa Group, all of which were financed from the highly lucrative
                        cocoa industry which was the mainstay of the regional economy

                    <legend><strong>Crisis in Western Nigeria</strong></legend>
                    <li> -
                        From the eve of independence, he led the Action Group as the Leader of the Opposition in the
                        federal parliament, leaving Samuel Ladoke Akintola as the Western Region Premier. Disagreements
                        between Awolowo and Akintola on how to run the Western region led the latter to an alliance with
                        the Tafawa Balewa-led NPC federal government. A constitutional crisis led to the declaration of
                        a state of emergency in the Western Region, eventually resulting in a widespread breakdown of
                        law and order.</li>
                    <hr>

                    <li>- Excluded from national government, Awolowo and his party faced an increasingly precarious
                        position. Akintola's followers, angered at their exclusion from power, formed the Nigerian
                        National Democratic Party (NNDP) under Akintola's leadership. Having previously suspended the
                        elected Western Regional Assembly, the federal government then reconstituted the body after
                        manoeuvres that brought Akintola's NNDP into power without an election. Shortly afterwards
                        Awolowo and several disciples were arrested, charged, convicted (of treason), and jailed for
                        conspiring with the Ghanaian authorities under Balewa to overthrow the federal government</li>

                    <legend><strong>His Lagacy</strong></legend>
                    <li> - The Obafemi Awolowo Foundation was founded as an independent, non-profit, non-partisan
                        organisation committed to furthering the symbiotic interaction of public policy and relevant
                        scholarship with a view to promoting the overall development of the Nigerian nation. The
                        Foundation was launched by the President of Nigeria at that time, General Ibrahim Babangida, at
                        the Liberty Stadium, Ibadan. However, his most important bequests (styled Awoism) are his
                        exemplary integrity, his welfarism, his contributions to hastening the process of decolonisation
                        and his consistent and reasoned advocacy of federalism-based on ethno-linguistic
                        self-determination and uniting politically strong states-as the best basis for Nigerian unity

                    <legend><strong>On 9 May 1987</strong></legend>
                    <li>- Awolowo died peacefully at his Ikenne home, the Efunyela Hall (so named after his mother), at
                        the age of 78 and was laid to rest in Ikenne, amid tributes across political and ethno-religious
                        divides

                <p>
                    "No matter how seemingly perfect or timely these words may appear, Obafemi was best still a man and
                    as such, had his pros and cons as a man and as a leader. In the end, it is not living long that
                    matters but leaving a legacy behind. I am certain that Chief Obafemi Awolowo‚Äôs name would find its
                    place on the walls of Nigeria‚Äôs greatest intellectual and political leaders."
